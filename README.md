Python 2.7 Script to get the date and time from a URL using Beautiful Soup

Written by Orion Blastar to demonstrate how to read a HTML file and get data from it in Python 2.7.

Hello http://www.syndk8.com guys and gals, I bet you can't even get this script to work because you don't know
how to install a library in Python? Hint, it uses Beautiful Soup 4, and you need the PIP command or download the library and run python setup.py in the directory you unziped it to.

Kudoz to you if you get this to work in Windoze or MacOSEcks, it is written for GNU/Linux like all of the other Dotcom 3.0 Startup apps.

A basic part of 'hacking' is to parse files and mine data from them. Which is what this script demos.
